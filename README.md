Old executables I made just to test the efficiency of the Nuitka compiler for Python, and raw C. 

Terminal commands are primitive/simple however you choose to look at it, just "./nameOfExecutable integer", where nameOfExecutable is, surprisingly, the name of the executable, and the integer is the upper bound under which all primes will be generated. Fair warning, all executables write to 'results.txt', which means that you either have to rename the file once you're done using one of the executables, or else the results from the new run will be appended to the file in Python list syntax.

As/If I choose to make more sieves, I'll add both Python and C implementations here.
