Old executables I made just to test the efficiency of the Nuitka compiler for Python, and raw C. 

Terminal commands are primitive/simple however you choose to look at it, just "./nameOfExecutable integer", where nameOfExecutable is, surprisingly, the name of the executable, and the integer is the upper bound under which all primes will be generated.

As/If I choose to make more sieves, I'll add both Python and C implementations here.
